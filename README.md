Churn Prediction Web Application
Overview
This project is a Flask web application designed to predict customer churn using a machine learning model. The application allows users to input various features related to customer behavior, and it uses a pre-trained Decision Tree model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

Features
User Interface: A form where users can input data such as Preferred Login Device, City Tier, Warehouse to Home distance, and more.
Prediction: The application predicts customer churn based on the input data.
Result Display: The prediction result is displayed on the same page after submission.
Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight web application framework in Python.
Bootstrap: A front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python, used for the decision tree model.
NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
